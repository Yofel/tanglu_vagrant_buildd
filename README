=== Vagrant configuration for a tanglu buildd ===

To use this you will need to add a tanglu box first, e.g.:
http://yofel.net/tanglu/vagrant/tanglu-2.0-amd64.box

== Set up a new builder ==
TODO

== Migrate an existing builder / Prepare a builder for re-provisioning ==

Back up any settings that are not covered by the vagrant provisioning

Back up the builder keys:
/srv/buildd/<element>.key
/srv/buildd/<element>.crt
/srv/buildd/<element>.pgp

You will need to export the builder secret pgp key, for that log into the
builder, then
$ sudo -u buildd -i
$ gpg --export-secret-key -a <element>@buildd.tanglu.org > /srv/buildd/<element>.sec
then backup /srv/buildd/<element>.sec

You will need the sbuild keys:
/var/lib/sbuild/apt-keys/sbuild-key.pub
/var/lib/sbuild/apt-keys/sbuild-key.sec

In the folder that contains the Vagrantfile, make a 'keys' folder and put
all keys in there. The provisioning will import the keys into the buildd
from there
